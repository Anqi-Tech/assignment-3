// Sample agent: JOY persona (SPEAKING-guided)
// This agent proposes a JOY frame with concrete constraints that encode
// the desired voice and style. It does not call an LLM; it is deterministic.
//
// Note: The pipeline in starter mode does not wire this agent yet.
// You can add it to `FramePipeline` and decide how your orchestrator
// consumes this JOY frame ‚Äî e.g., map it to key/genre/ends/participants/norms
// or treat it as a high-priority persona overlay.
